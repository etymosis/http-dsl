#INTRO
http is immensely powerful and a lot of internet traffic is done over http. Integrating services together is often done with REST, where developers need to spend valuble configuring an http client to speak a particular API's syntax and consume the payload in a service-specific way.

The goal of this project is to simply http request/response for REST apis. Ideally to strip down http requests to a series of configuration files describing how to build the request and how to parse the response in a language-agnostic way.
